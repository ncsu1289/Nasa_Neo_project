# Project Title: Determining and Modeling Hazardous Near Earth Objects

## Team Members:
- Dwayne Bost
- Jared Klein

## Datasets used:
- NASA's Open API (NeoWs), NASA's SENTRY csv, NASA's FIREBALL csv

## Project Description:
- Classifying, predicting, and modeling NEOs (Near Earth Objects).

## Research Questions to Answer and elements to discuss:
- When was the most recent event?
- Miss Distance.
- Classifying potentially hazardous NEOs.
- Relationship between size vs passing Distance.
- Speed or relative velocity vs. passing Distance.
- Orbits of NEOs.

## Reasons for this project (purpose):
