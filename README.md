# Project Title: Determining and Modeling Hazardous Near Earth Objects

## Team Members:
- Dwayne
- Jared
- Michael Ebanks

## Ideas:
- Nasa Data asteroid

## Project Description/Outline:
- The data was fascinating, had predictive dates for when they reach they’re closest approach date. There’s also data

## Research Questions to Answer and possible plots:
- When was the most recent event?
- Miss Distance
- Potentially hazerdous
- Relationship between size vs passing Distance
- speed or relative velocity vs. passing Distance
-

## Data Sets to be used:
- NASA NeoFeed on Asteroids (requires API Key)

## Reasons for this project (purpose):
- Asteroids could someday threaten Earth.
- Governments and scientists use asteroids to study the cosmos.
- Good for education purposes.
- Warn general public about potential asteroids impacts.

## Who is the Data for? Who could use it?
- Companies who wish deploy satellites.
- Governments.
- Scientists.
- Educators.
- Meteorologists.
- Scientists interested in deflecting asteroids.
