# Modeling Hazardous Near Earth Objects
======

## Project Leads:
- Dwayne Bost
- Jared Klein

## Description:
- This repository is home to a project on hazardous near earth objects (NEOs).
Here, we look at the orbits of NEOs nearest to Earth by modeling their proximity
to Earth, analyzing their characteristics, and determining whether or not these NEOs
are actually threatening to Earth.

## Datasets used:
- NASA's Open API (NeoWs), NASA's SENTRY csv, NASA's FIREBALL csv

## Technologies used:
- Python and its many analytics packages(pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, astropy, poliastro, request, json, csv,).
- Microsoft Powerpoint.

## Elements Discussed:
- When was the most recent event?
- Miss Distance.
- Classifying potentially hazardous NEOs.
- Relationship between size vs passing Distance.
- Speed or relative velocity vs. passing Distance.
- Orbits of NEOs.

## Reasons for this project (purpose):
- Asteroids could someday threaten Earth.
- Governments and scientists use asteroids to study the cosmos.
- Good for education purposes.
- Warn general public about potential asteroids impacts.

## Who is the Data for? Who could use it?
- Companies who wish deploy satellites.
- Governments.
- Scientists.
- Educators.
- Meteorologists.
- Scientists interested in deflecting asteroids.
